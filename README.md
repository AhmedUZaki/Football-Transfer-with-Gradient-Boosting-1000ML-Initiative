# Football Transfer with Gradient Boosting  | 1000ML Initiative

This project is a part of the Machine Learning Track at the 1000ML initiative and aims to predict football player transfer values using gradient-boosting algorithms.

 The project utilizes a dataset containing historical football transfer records and player attributes. By analyzing the dataset,.

 The project builds a machine learning model to predict player transfer values, which can help football clubs to make informed decisions while buying and selling players.

## Dataset
